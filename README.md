# ERC1400
ERC1400 is a hybrid token standard precisely designed for the use case of tokenized financial assets:
By being ERC20 retrocompatible, it remains compatible with the majority of existing tools and platforms.
By being partially-fungible (hybrid token), it allows to represent different classes of assets, perform more evolved token actions (lock tokens, collateralize tokens, etc.), which is essential in the context of corporate actions.
# Descriptions


Granular transfer controls: Possibility to perform granular controls on the transfers with a system of certificates (injected in the additional data field of the transfer method)


Controllers: Empowerment of controllers with the ability to send tokens on behalf of other addresses (e.g. force transfer).


Partionned tokens (partial-fungibility): Every ERC1400 token can be partitioned. The partition of a token, can be seen as the state of a token. It is well adapted for representing, classes of assets, performing corporate actions, etc.


Document management: Possibility to bind tokens to hashes of legal documents, thus making the link between a blockchain transaction and the real world.
